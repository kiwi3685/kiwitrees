<h3><strong>MyOOS [Dumper]</strong> based on MySQLDumper 1.24.4</h3>

<h3>About this project</h3>
<p><strong>MyOOS [Dumper]</strong> is an improved version of MySQLDumper 1.24.4 (January 24, 2011). This enhancement takes into account the development of PHP.</p>.
<p>Most of all stability, security and handling are the main focus of <strong>MyOOS [Dumper]</strong>. But also an attractive template is included, which can be edited and adapted to your own needs.</p>.


<p><strong>MyOOS [Dumper]</strong> is a backup program for MySQL databases, written in PHP and Perl. With it, backup copies of the data (store, blog, etc.) can be created and restored if necessary. Especially for web space without shell access, MyOOS [Dumper] is a useful alternative.</p>. 

<p>The idea for MySQLDumper came from Daniel Schlichtholz. He opened the MySQLDumper forum in 2004, whereupon programmers wrote new scripts and extended existing ones.</p>

<h3>MyOOS [Dumper] Help</h3>

<h4>Download</h4>
<p>You can always get the latest versions via GitHub<br>.
<a href="https://github.com/r23/MyOOS/releases" target="_blank">https://github.com/r23/MyOOS/releases</a></p>


<h4>System requirement</h4>.
<p>The script works on any server (Windows, Linux, ...) <br>
with PHP >= version 7.2 with GZip support, MySQL (version 4.1 or higher), JavaScript (must be enabled)</p>.
<p>Copy the mod folder from the MyOOS archive to a separate working folder.</p>.

<h4>Installation</h4></a>.
The installation process is straightforward.
<p>From the MyOOS archive, copy the mod folder into any folder.<br>
Upload all the files from the mod folder to your web server. (For example, to the lowest level in [server web directory/]mod)<br>
... done!<br>
You can now call MyOOS [Dumper] in your web browser by "https://example.com/mod/",<br>
to complete the installation. Just follow the instructions.<br>
<br><b>Note:</b><br><i>If on your server the script is not allowed to create directories,<br>
you have to do this manually, because MyOOS [Dumper] stores the data ordered in
directories.<br> 
The script aborts with an appropriate statement!<br>
After you have created the directories (according to the hint), it runs normally and without restrictions.</i>

<a name="perl"></a><h4>Perl script instructions</h4>.
Most have a cgi-bin directory where perl can be run. <br>
This is usually accessible by browser via http://www.example.com/cgi-bin/. <br>
<br>
For this case, please perform the following steps:<br><br>.

1. call the Backup page in MyOOS [Dumper] and click on "Backup Perl". <br>
2. copy the path that is behind entry in crondump.pl for $absolute_path_of_configdir:. <br>
3. open the file "crondump.pl" in the editor.<br>
4. enter the copied path there at absolute_path_of_configdir (no spaces).<br>
5. save crondump.pl .<br>
6. copy crondump.pl, as well as perltest.pl and simpletest.pl into the cgi-bin directory (ascii mode in FTP).<br>
7. give the files the permissions 755.<br>
7b. If the ending cgi is desired, change the ending of all 3 files from pl -> cgi (rename). <br>
8. call the configuration in MyOOS [Dumper].<br>
9. select the page Cronscript. <br>
10. change perl execution path to /cgi-bin/ .<br>
10b. If the scripts have .pl, change the file extension to .cgi .<br>
11.Save the configuration. <br><br>

Done, the scripts can now be called from the backup page.<br><br>.

For those who can run Perl in all directories, the following steps will suffice:<br><br>.

1. call in the MyOOS [Dumper] the page Backup. <br>
2. copy the path that is behind entry in crondump.pl for $absolute_path_of_configdir:. <br>
3. open the file "crondump.pl" in the editor. <br>
4. enter the copied path there at absolute_path_of_configdir (no spaces). <br>
5. save crondump.pl .<br>
6. give the files the permissions 755. <br>
6b. If the extension cgi is desired, change the extension of all 3 files from pl -> cgi (rename). <br>
(ev. 10b+11 from above)<br>
<br>

Windowsuser have to change the first line of all scripts, there is the path of Perl. Example: <br>
instead of: #!/usr/bin/perl -w <br>
now: #!C:_usr/bin/perl.exe -w <br>

<h4>Operation</h4><ul>.

<h6>Menu</h6>.
In the selection list above you set the database.<br>
All actions refer to the database set here.

<h6>Home</h6>
Here you can learn about your system, the different installed versions and details about the
versions and details about the configured databases.<br>
If you click on the database name, you will see a list of the tables with the number of entries
with the number of entries, the size and the last update date.

<h6>Configuration</h6>.

	<li><a name="conf3"></a><strong>GZip compression:</strong> Here you can enable compression. It is recommended to enable it, because the files will be much smaller after all and disk space is always scarce.</li>.
	<li><a name="conf5"></a><strong>Email with Dumpfile:</strong> If this option is enabled, an email with the dump as an attachment will be sent after the backup is complete (caution, compression should absolutely be on, otherwise the attachment will be too large and may not be sent!).</li>
